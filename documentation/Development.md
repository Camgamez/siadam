The course it's almost over, you only have a couple of weeks to ensure there is a dataentry app fully developed to add consult information from the database. Your colleagues are very busy with other courses, the website will most likely be vibecoded.

You've never developed a website before, but as you have access to a basic hosting plan at hostinger, you decide to give it a try. You start by testing the script on the server's dbms: phpMyAdmin, the script runs beautifully. 

So you continue with the website development. The plan gives you access to this Horizons tool, this is an AI assistant to create the website files, so you run the promt and it gives you a great website, however it doesn't connect to the database on the server and is asking you to integrate a supabase or create an API on the server.

That is going to either be expensive or take way longer, so you decide to take another route: you ask deepseek to create a MVC website to add and remove files from the database, and with that you manage to speed run the website itself. It is not as pretty as it could have been had you used the react website created with Horizons, but it serves the purpose requested by the teacher and works as expected.

All in all this has been a very insightfull experience, now you know how to design databases, the teacher does have a couple of notes regarding the designs, particularly about how the conceptual model does not reflect the subentities displayed on the logical model, but you've managed to complete all the requirements on schedule and the teacher is actually very happy with the project. 

In the end he gives you a good grade (4.3/5.0), it wasn't really all that impossible to get an above avarage grade with him. You still don't like him, but you can't deny that this was a very educational course.

The project could be developed further, you still have to automate integrations with open APIs like the airport weather stations and forecasts, but that is going to be a problem for your future self.

I hope this repo was an entertaining read that shows my thought process on database design.
