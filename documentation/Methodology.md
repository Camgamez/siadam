# Methodology.

The teacher keeps making at least one annoying comment about how much money he makes, kinda suggesting that this is because of his knowledge in databases, but honestly it only reads as him being insecure, and along with his "hot takes" in politics, this class is getting annoying fast. However, one thing is true and that is: he has a great methodology for desingning databases described below.

## The 11 steps for designing a database:

You have chosen the topic for your database: aeronautics and meteorology. You have some relatives in that industry, and they have mentioned in passing that there's a lot of open data that can be queried, so this sounds like a great place to start. So you write down the steps your hiddeous teacher provided for designing databases: 

  0. Divide and conquer.
  1. Estimate entities.
  2. Find relations between entities.
  3. Caracterize those relations.
  4. Define attributes.
  5. Design a conceptual model.
  6. Resolve n:m relations using auxiliary entities.
  7. Caracterize the new entities and their relations.
  8. Design the Logical model.
  9. Design the physical model.
  10. Create and run the database script. 

And you start working with your team on the project.
