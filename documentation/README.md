This folder includes the currently existing documentation for the AMDIS proyect.
As this project was originally born as a school project, you will find:
- A pre project detailing the origin of the idea.
- A methodology document, containing the steps taken to design the database.
- A zip file in which you will find power dessigner models used to create the project until now.

All this documentation is currently in spanish and is being translated and complemented into English for better outreach.

The database currently has the following restrictions:
- Each person can only posses one type of license for each aircraft.
- Each flight only has one cabir crewmember (when a whole crew is required).
- Pilots are not creating the flight plans for each route.
