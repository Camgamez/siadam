# Let me tell you why I hate my teacher with all my guts:

When you don't know how to tell a story, some people always comment: "*start from the beggining*". What do you mean *start from the beggining*? that's dumb. What's the begginig? If I knew how to begin a story, I would have done it already you know?. I've always find that phrase so weird because how do you define the beggining? I'm not just going to start talking to you about my childhood fears and dreams, you know? 

But my grandpa would always say "when you don't know how to start, then start from the end". That at least kinda makes sense in a way, just let the feeling out first, ramble a bit about it and would hear me out over a chess board while lazily moving pieces. I'm writting all of this because I want to vent about a teacher I personally never really liked. 

Despite what the text may suggest in the following files, while I may have a really strong feeling towards this person, I don't really hate them or whish them or their family any harm, nor is this text any invitation to harm any body.

I promise you there is a reason you are reading all of this. While other repositories may be more tool-oriented, this repo will have a more relaxed language that may include some slurs and emojis in the text to better convey emotions. 

## How it started: 

Imagine: it's 11 am on a Wednesday morning, the capital-city morning rush is slowly turning into a peacefull rumble before the chaos of the lunch hour. You are on campus, about to enter the third classroom of the fourth floor in the Technology and Science building at the National University, you don't know this teacher yet as you missed the first class because of a conflict with your work schedule that couldn't be resolved with PTO or swapping shifts.

You remind yourself of the email you sent to the teacher asking about the topics of the first class, that went completely unanswered. It was never about asking if the class could be done remotely. You were just trying to let them know before hand that due to your work schedule, you were unable to assist that first class. Did he read it in that tone? 

You sit down at the first computer you find available in the room, the teacher comes in, looks at you and a couple other students and inmediatly says "oh, I see new faces! Wonderful, we can review the rules again." and proceeds to rant about how the grade is 50% a theoric test, 50% a proyect and only 5% of all the students he's ever had have received a grade above 4.3 over 5, and you can only think "He is one of those, this is going to be interesting."

## Just, what are you talking about? 

Ok, ok, I'll get to the meat of the project. Fast forward a couple of days, the course reassingment week is over you are stuck with this teacher for the rest of the semester, as no other other course (apart from one on axiomatic set theory, whatever that means) has a better schedule to fit in with work. 

"As reassignment week is over, it's good if you guys start choosing groups for the project" says the teacher mid class, and follows it up with "remember you will have to design a database with at least 10 entities. You will be able to choose any topic, just don't come with projects about school courses, I want something interesting, you get points if you resolve a real life problem".

Great! this gets you thinking, you remember how your brother, who works with planes, is always manually checking the airpot's weather station from a website in his phone. There's got to be something that can be done with that right?
