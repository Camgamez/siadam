# Let me tell you why I hate my teacher with all my guts:

Imagine: it's 11 am on a Wednesday morning, the capital-city morning rush is slowly turning into a peaceful rumble before the chaos of the lunch hour. You are on campus, about to enter the third classroom of the fourth floor in the Technology and Science building at the National University, you don't know this teacher yet as you missed the first class because of a conflict with your work schedule that couldn't be resolved with PTO or swapping shifts.

You remind yourself of the email you sent to the teacher asking about the topics of the first class, that went completely unanswered. It was never about asking if the class could be done remotely. You were just trying to let them know that due to your work schedule, you were unable to assist that first class. Did he read it in that tone? 

You sit down at the first computer you find available in the room, the teacher comes in, looks at you and a couple other students and inmediatly says "oh, I see new faces! Wonderful, we can review the rules again." and proceeds to rant about how the grade is 50% a knowlegde review and 50% a proyect, then ends up the rant saying that only 5% of all the students he's ever had have received a grade above 4.3 over 5, and you can only think "He is a one of those old school teachers that beleives you learn more when you suffer. This is going to be interesting."

## But what is this github all about?

Ok, ok, I'll get to the meat of the project. Fast forward a couple of days, the course reassingment week is over you are stuck with this teacher for the rest of the semester, as no other other course (apart from one on axiomatic set theory, whatever that means) has a better schedule to fit in with work. 

Next class, the teacher starts with: "As reassignment week is over, it's good if you guys start choosing groups for the project" and follows it up with "remember you will have to design a database with at least 10 entities. You will be able to choose any topic, just don't come with projects about school courses. I want something interesting, you get points if you resolve a real life problem".

Long story short, this repo is the story of how you learnt how to design and query databases despite having an annoying teacher. For organization purposes, you will find a detailed description of the project in the [project-sumary.md](project-sumary.md) file. Further reading can be found on the /Documentation folder. On one hand, the [Methodology.md]() file describes the steps taken to ensure the database is designed with approriate normalization. On the other hand, the [queries-and-development]() file describes the steps taken to create the queries and develop a data-entry website to go along with the database.

## Just a quick PSA

While I don't really like this teacher, this repo is only intended to be a display of a school project through a simple story. In no way, shape or form the goal is to offend or attack anyone. Thus, in order to protect people's integrities, all the names in the story will be changed. I hope you find this reading enjoyable.
