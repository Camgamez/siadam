# The Actual Project.

At this point the teacher has only given a brief description of what the project will be. As of now, all his classes have the same structure:
 - The first 30 minutes, he starts talking about his opinion on current events like the political landscape of the faculty and for some reason, the country. You don't really hate him for this, but he could focus more on fostering a healthy debate enviroment than just giving out his opinion.
 - Then, he spends arround one hour or so actually talking about the topic at hand: databases. You actually find this part very interesting. You start realizing that data is everywhere and information is the relations and abstractions you can take out of that data. 
 - Last 30 minutes of class are what really makes him out to be a really annoying person: while finishing the explanations for the day, he likes to give examples of the topic while flaunting his wealth in front of a bunch of yound adults.

## Let me give you an example of what I mean:

It's 11 am on a Monday, you are already in the classroom when the teacher comes in. He greats everyone and starts talking about how he finds so unjust that a judge has condemned a political figure in the country that has a really shady past. You give him the benefit of the doubt on that one, he is definitely in that age groupd that thinks you should only ever read about one politician and follow them blindly, but who has energy for that so early in the week.

Then, 30 minutes of his speach go by and he finally starts talking about databases, he mentions the importance of ensuring all tables have a primary key, how data is physically saved in headered block files, different file formats like Json, YAML, XML and so on. 

For a moment you think "whoa, this guy really knows what he is talking about". Right after, he wants to make an example about the difference between data and information, so he picks a random student in the classroom and ask "what brand is your wrist-watch?". The student, a bit startled is trying to give an answer, and before they answer, the teacher retorts back "I have a rolex, you could create a text field called 'Brand' and that gives you information about how expensive a watch is". 

Honestly, that's the moment I realized this dude and I won't really get along well. A very smart person who definitely know what he is talking about, but someone with the need to flaunt his money in front of people half his age is not really someone I can trust. 

## Ok but what about the project?

Oh yeah! you are right, let me get back to business, cus by the end of that class he gives us the whole rubric for the project in groups of 5:

 1. We have to design a database with at least 10 different entities. 
 2. From the database created we must show 18 different functioning queries.
